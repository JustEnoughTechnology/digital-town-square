### Being online should not be painful
The online dissemination of ideas should not be as difficult as it has become.
Our goal is to provide a way for folks to interact in a manner like the mythical town square worked.

A note that at the moment there are 3 numbered points. That will increase over time as I get feedback

1. You want to get up on a soapbox and talk to the crowd
    - Maybe someone talks back,
      - Maybe the crowd grows large enough that you decide to take the conversation to a hall (invitation only or open to all)
    - Maybe you are talking to yourself (It happens)
    - Maybe someone comes along and heckles you
      - If they are very rude you can wave your hand and they will vanish from sight. Anything that they keep saying to you will vanish as well
      - If they have a bunch of annoying friends you can make them disappear the same wayl
      - If they were throwing fruit, veggies and rocks the police will come by to keep the peace
        - Might mean letting them sit quietly in the corner for a couple hours while they contemplate the error of their ways
        - Might mean banishing the person from town forever
        - Might mean something in between
2. You want to put up pamphlets or posters on the wall or on a table for folks to pick up
    - You can sneak in during "the night" and anonymously post them where all can see
    - You can tack them up at midday with your name signed at the bottom
    - You can have a tip jar for folks to contribute if they like what you are writing
      - Secure
      - Anonymous (if either you or the contributor desires)
      - A mouse can come along and toss in some amount every day/week/month if someone trains the mouse to do that
    - You can tear down the posters or toss out the pamphlets
    - The police can also tear down posters or toss out pamphlets but only in the case where it is determined that they are a threat to someone or the community at large
    - Nobody else can destroy your work
3. You want to hire a hall on a regular basis or on a one-off (see above)
    - You can rent a private hall where you can charge admission (or not, it is up to you)
    - You can borrow a public hall, but you can't charge admission for public events
    - folks that enter can be themselves or can wear a mask that makes them pseudonymous
      - This does not make them immune from the usual rules, if they misbehave while pseudonymous they will get banished
